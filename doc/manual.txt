The SAIRD model
---------------

Drug resistance data is stored and arranged in SAIRD in this way:

* The central records stored are *suseptibility reports*. These detail patient
  data and drug treatment. Each report is allocated to a specific *season* and
  *country*.

* A country is given geographical area or reporting region.

* A season is a period, that starts on a given day and continues until that
  day on the following year.

* Users must have accounts and are linked to a given country. They can see and
  edit data only for the countries for which they have permission. Data from
  other countries can only be seen in aggregate.

* Administrators can 

Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Subsections within the SAIRD site are given either as the name of the section
or as the relative url from the base of the site. For example:

	*Trials*
	``/trials/new``

Where a sequence of menus or choices must be followed, these are given as a
series of steps in typewriter font. For example:

	``Home > Seasons > Add a season``
