SAIRD Manual and How-To
=======================

Introduction
------------

Emerging drug resistance is a urgent problem in public health. In many common
diseases like influenza and tuberculosis, it is critical to record and share
resistance data so as to prepare interventions and appropriate clinical
treatments. SAIRD - the South American Influenza Resistance Database - is a
web-based system for tracking and comparing resistance data across a number of
reporting regions, allowing the saving and searching of resistance trends.


The SAIRD model & concepts
--------------------------

To build a mental model of how SAIRD works, drug resistance data is stored
and arranged in SAIRD in this way:

* In a paragraph: *Members* will enter and view *susceptibility reports* for
  specific *countries*, *seasons* and *virus types*. These can be compared
  against *thresholds* (which are also specific for particular countries,
  seasons and virus types). Special *tools* are available to for complicated
  searching, comparison and graphing of the data.

* A *country* is given geographical area or reporting region, with
  associated members.

* A *season* is a year-long period, that starts on a given day and continues until that
  day on the following year. 
  
* Users of SAIRD are grouped into several categories:

	* *Members* are associated with countries and cannot see data for other
	  countries:
	
		* *Readers*: can only see data for their country, but not add to or edit
		  it.
	
		* *Editors*: can add to or edit the data associated with a country.

	* *Administrators*: special privileged users,, they can create, edit or
	  delete everything.

* The central records stored are *susceptibility reports*. These report
  an instance of observed resistance in a given *season* and *country*. This
  is recorded as a measure of resistance against one or more *drugs*,
  *sequence data* and *mutations* and *patient* information. 

* Susceptibility reports are usefully compared to *seasonal thresholds*. These
  give minor and major limits for a given drug resistance found in a virus
  type in a season and country. 


Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Subsections within the SAIRD site are given either as the name of the section
or as the relative url from the base of the site. For example:

	*Trials*
	``/trials/new``

Where a sequence of menus or choices must be followed, these are given as a
series of steps in typewriter font. For example:

	``Home > Seasons > Add a season``


For users
---------

How do I join the site?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can create an account yourself, but:

* You won't be able to log in until have activated your account by clicking on
  a link received in your email.
  
* Then your account won't be able to do or see anything until an administrator
  associates you with a reporting country and gives you the appropriate
  permissions.
  
It may be easier to just ask an administrator to create the account for you.

Note that if you have a `Gravatar <http://gravatar.com>`__ for the email
address you use, it will appear next to your name in the system.


How do I browse susceptibility reports & seasonal thresholds?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the toolbar on the top of every page, there are links to thus. Click the
appropriate one and you see a list or reports or thresholds. Note that you
will only see those you have access to, i.e. those for countries in which
you are a member:

	/thresholds
	/susceptibilities

Click on any of the listed items to go to the individual reports. Note that
in the report you can click on the linked season, country, virus type or
drug resistance to the detail pages for them.


How do I add a susceptibility report?

Just like susceptibility reports, you can edit and add to a seasonal
threshold later. For example, you might 



For administrators
------------------

Who can do what?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For security, there are different classes of users in SAIRD. They are:

* Users: everyone with an account on SAIRD. Unless they are granted
  permissions, they can do very little.
  
* Administrators: special privileged users,, they can create, edit or
  delete everything.
  
* Members: users that are associated with countries. These will form the bulk
  of users, people who can see and create data for that country. Ordinarily
  members cannot see data that is not associated with their country.
  However, a user can be a member of more than one country. Members come in
  three types:
  
	* Editors: are members that are allowed to create and delete data for their
	  country.
	  
	* Readers: are members that can only see data for their country, but not
	  add to or edit it.
	  
	* Managers: members with special administrative powers over their country.
	  Note that at the moment managers have only a few small extra abilities
	  over editors.


How do I change / edit / create X?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most common cases are listed below, but just about everything is editable
in SAIRD. You can browse the lists of data in by going to the appropriate url,
e.g.:

	``/Thresholds``
	``/Users``
	etc.
	
Links to all of these can be found on the ``Tools`` page.

Something to keep in mind is that SAIRD stores two types of data:

* Data: i.e., the usual user-entered information that will: thresholds,
  susceptibility reports etc.
  
* Vocabularies: the lists of choices that are used through the system:
  countries, drug resistances, virus types etc. These can only be
  edited by the administrator. These will change rarely if at all (largely
  only when a new drug or pathogen or reporting region is added) and
  should almost never be deleted.


How do I create a user?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Go to the users index page at ``/users``. This can also be found from the
  Tools page at ``Tools > User administration > Users``.
  
* Click ``Create new user``.

* Fill in their name, username, email address and password.

Note that usernames and email addresses have to be unique throughout the
system.
