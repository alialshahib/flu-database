Things to do
============

Must do
-------

* Security mechanisms with regard to country

* Graphing

* Import excel

* Tools controller

* Decide on user-joining model: anyone join, or invite only?

* Change logo

* Screenshots for Monica

* Check & trial in IE

* Set "contact" address in footer


Should do
---------

* Validations?

* There is no site map - make one or delete footer pointer

* Pagination in long listings of users, countries, etc.

* Think: should patient location be user editable / addable

* Unify names

* Enhance index page search facilities.

* Do they have some artwork we can use?

* We currently have three "quick-link" areas on the page - the tool / navigation
  bar, the footer and the sidebar. A bit excessive, really only need two. 

* Admin tools / links in a more discrete place?


Like to do
----------

* Localization / translation?

* "Backto/upto" menu named appropriately

* Proper parent link possible?

* Normalize style sheet & colors

* Indexes show bad capitalization "There are 3 Countries"

* Give every country an icon or whatever for easy visuals

* Search / side box styling needs a bit of tweaking.

* Replace Thresholdentry with ThresholdReportEntry & Susceptibility with SusceptibilityReport

* On a "new" page, have a "save and create another"?

* "Cancel" on edit page goes to where?

* All genes or just the ones they are using? And do they want genes or chromosomes?

* Set string field lengths

* Choose font styling

* Style sidebar better

* Fill in help docs

* Tool icons

* User head shots

* Adjust whitespace in show profiles

* Have the idea of a country manager

* Drug "other" is a cell based test

* Spreadsheet formats

* Pointers to full data browsing on tools page

* try out Hobo controller as tools page?

* H3 is a bit crowded

* PII / encryption on patient DOB

* Those goddamn edit/remove buttons

* Back button on tools

* Highlights / style changes for error and required fields

* Some sort of message or whatever for tool success?


Have done
---------

* Gravatar picture on member card

* "Users" become "members"

* Countries to upper case (and in proper domain table)

* Record modification date byline

* "config.load_paths is deprecated and removed in Rails 3, please use
  autoload_paths instead"

* Full admin page / options

* Need objects for susceptibility report entry, genes & locations

* Enter vocabulary for countries, seasons, drugs, genes

* Ordered indexes of country, season, drug, gene, virus types

* Patient table doesn't need both "patient" and "title"

* Textbox sizes on account page are bloody small

* Static docs for help

* Changed SAID to SAIRD for google-a-bility
